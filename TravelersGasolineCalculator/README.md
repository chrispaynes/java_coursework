# Traveler's Gasoline Calculator

----
## Purpose
Create an application that calculates various traveling elements (gas mileage, oil changes, and tank capacity).

The specifics of the mileage, oil changes, gas costs, and vehicle types are listed below:

* Miles Per Gallon (MPG): 15
* Oil Change Cost: $30.00
* Oil Change Required: Every 3,000 miles

----
## Program Requirements
1. The application should initially allow users to enter values for the number of miles, the number of gallons, and the cost of gasoline.
2. The application should also accept input from users that enables them to reset the value on the screen to zero (0) so that another calculation can be performed.
3. Your application should also display output, and users should be able to access the calculator via the Web, a console application and a PDA.
4. The application should include the company logo in the interface (create your own logo).
5. Your application also allows users to size the window and exit the application at any time.
